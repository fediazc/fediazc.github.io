<p>
    The art showcased here was generated by AI (using VQGAN+CLIP).
    The exact prompt used to obtain each piece is shown below the image.
    I don't have anything deep or profound to say about AI art other than
    it's really fun to "make". You feel more like a director than an artist, but
    it's still interesting to explore what they AI can and can't do and what
    it comes up with. I made a
    <a href="/2021/07/16/creating-art-with-AI.html">short tutorial</a> for how
    to make AI art if you're interested.

    came up with this method of making art with AI.
